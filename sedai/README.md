## Overview

Sedai is an autonomous cloud platform that proactively manages production environments to prevent issues and improve availability, performance, and cloud costs. As an intelligent autopilot for SREs, Sedai independently detects, prioritizes, and analyzes monitoring data for opportunities to safely and autonomously act in production - all without thresholds or human intervention.

Enable this integration to receive notifications in Datadog about actions Sedai autonomously executes in your production environments.

### How it Works

* **Agentless:** Seamlessly connects to your cloud accounts and automatically discovers and understands production environments.

* **Configuration-free:** Easily connects to Datadog API and other APM/Observability platforms, and intelligently identifies, prioritizes and learns metric behavior.

* **Proactive Actions:** Safely acts in production on your behalf to ensure resources avoid availability issues and run optimally at all times.

## Setup

In Sedai:

* Navigate to Settings > Integrations and add your Datadog account.
* Under Settings > Notifications, [select which notifications][3] you want to send to Datadog.
