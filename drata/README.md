# Drata

## Overview

Drata is a security and compliance automation platform that continuously monitors and collects evidence of a company's security controls, while streamlining compliance workflows end-to-end to ensure audit readiness.

This integration allows [Drata][5] customers to forward their compliance-related logs and events from Datadog to Drata via an API integration.

## Setup

To set up this integration, you must have an active [Drata account][6]. You must also have proper [admin permissions][7] in Datadog.

### Installation

1. To install this integration, you'll need to create an API and App key. 
2. Navigate to your organization settings to [create an API key][2] in Datadog. Give the key a meaningful name such as `Drata`.
3. Copy and save your API `Key`.
4. Within your organization settings, [create an application key][3]. 
5. Copy and save your application key.
