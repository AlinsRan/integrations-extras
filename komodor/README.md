# Komodor - Kubernetes Troubleshooting Platform

## Overview

This integration allows Datadog Monitor Alerts to be available in the Komodor Kubernetes troubleshooting platform and to suggest related services based on service connections detected by Datadog.

Komodor tracks changes across your entire K8s stack analyzes their ripple effect and provides you with the context you need to troubleshoot efficiently and independently.

### Turning troubleshooting chaos into clarity
Today's microservices systems are complex, distributed and they are constantly changing. Keeping track of so many moving parts in so many places often seems nearly impossible!

Komodor is the missing piece in your DevOps toolchain and offers one unified platform from which you can gain a deep understanding of all of your system events, changes and their effect.

### Empower on-call teams
Make the knowledge and expertise that has traditionally been held by only a few, clear and visible to Dev and SRE teams.

### Understand your kubernetes
Gain the K8s visibility you are lacking. See your deployments on a timeline with the relevant information: what changed, what code was pushed and by whom.

### Track your system end-to-end
View data from your Git, config, infra, alerting and other tools, in one centralized and easy-to-understand display.

### Uncovering the context
Troubleshoot your microservices based on the most relevant context, connections and dependencies.

### Increase business velocity
Optimize the troubleshooting process and free your devs-on-call to focus on their daily strategic work. Innovate faster without increasing operational risk.

### Increase performance and availability
Detect and resolve issues to prevent escalation. Enable any on-call developer to quickly uncover root causes and get the right teams involved for rapid resolution.

### Save on costs and scale smoothly
Manage your ever-growing system complexity, change frequency and alert volume without having to grow headcount and without an increasing burnout rate. Boost resolution rates, involve fewer people in the process and release DevOps bottlenecks seamlessly.
