## Overview
SaaS Apps like Office 365, Slack, Zoom, and Salesforce are vital to a business's day-to-day operations, but can often introduce new security challenges. Adaptive Shield's SaaS Security Posture Management solution (SSPM) features proactive, deep, continuous and automated monitoring and management of all business critical SaaS applications. By integrating with all SaaS apps within minutes, Adaptive Shield enables security teams to gain complete control over their SaaS apps, allowing them to harden their security policies and reduce risks.

With the Adaptive Shield integration, you can track and monitor SaaS posture alerts, such as configuration drifts, integration failures, and security check degradations, as Datadog Events.
