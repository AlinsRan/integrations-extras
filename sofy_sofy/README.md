# Sofy

## Overview

Sofy is a no-code platform for creating automated tests on Â mobile Apps. Users can integrated with their CI/CD pipelines to execute tests on real devices and view the results of their functional tests along with performance metrics.

With this integration, you have deeper insight into your testing process by visualizing key metrics and trends such as load time, network, memory utilization and CPU. The out-of-the-box dashboard provides real-time visibility into your SOFY test results, enabling you to monitor and analyze performance over time and make data-driven decisions to improve overall software quality.

## Data Collected
