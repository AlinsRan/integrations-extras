# BlinkOps Integration

## Overview

The Datadog integration for [Blink][1] enables you to trigger automations in response to new incidents. You can also create, update, and view incidents and events in the Datadog event stream.

## Setup

Visit [our documentation][2] for details on how to integrate BlinkOps with Datadog.

## Data Collected

### Events

Blink automations let you send events and incidents to the Datadog event stream. 
Searching and updating incidents is also supported with the Datadog integration in Blink.

You can also configure Blink to run an automation when an incident is created.

### Monitors

Blink does not include any monitors, but the Datadog integration can view, modify, and create monitors.

### Metrics

Blink does not include any metrics, however you can query and list metrics from your Datadog environment for use in Blink automations.
