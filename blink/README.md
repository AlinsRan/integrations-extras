# BlinkOps Integration

## Overview

The Datadog integration for [Blink][1] enables you to trigger automations in response to new incidents. You can also create, update, and view incidents and events in the DataDog event stream.

## Setup

Visit [our documentation][2] for details on how to integrate BlinkOps with Datadog.

## Data Collected

### Events

BlinkOps lets you send events, incidents, and monitors your Datadog event stream from a Blink automation.
Searching and updating incidents is also supported with the Datadog integration in Blink.

### Metrics

BlinkOps does not include any metrics, however you can query and list metrics from your Datadog environment for use in Blink automations.
