        Whether to collect heap, mutex, or block profiles as cumulative profiles
        since the program started. If false, requests those profiles over the
        period specified by "duration".
        
        In order to use profile aggregation, "cumulative" must set to false.

        Note that setting "cumulative" to false will cause the profiled
        application to use more memory in order to compute the profiles.
