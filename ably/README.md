## Overview
The [Ably][1] platform is used to power realtime use cases such as multiplayer, chat, data synchronisation, data broadcast and notifications, for high-scale web and mobile applications around the world.

Using our APIs, engineers are free to focus on building core functionality, rather than having to provision and maintain servers and cloud infrastructure.

Using Ablyâ€™s Datadog Integration, you can:
- Monitor realtime application metrics across your Ably applications
- Track messages, channels and connection usage
- Identify unexpected activity and troubleshoot potential issues
